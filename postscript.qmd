# Postscript

> As long as Algebra and Geometry have been separated, their progress has been slow and their usages limited; but when these two sciences were reunited, they lent each other mutual strength and walked together with a rapid step towards perfection.
>

Count Joseph-Louis de Lagrange (1795)

> We know that Descartes' fusion of algebra and geometry proved no less fruitful for one of these sciences than for the other. For, while on the one hand, geometers learned, through contact with analysis, to give their research a previously unknown generality, analysts, for their part, found powerful help in the images of geometry, both to discover their theorems and to state them in a simple and striking form.

Camille Jordan, [__Essai sur la géométrie à $n$ dimensions__](https://www.numdam.org/item/?id=BSMF_1875__3__103_2), 1875.

_This paper introduced the notion of angles between flats, which is equivalent to the statistical technique of Canonical Correlation Analysis._

## Future courses to take at BU

There are many courses you can go on to from here, which will rely on your understanding of linear algebra:

* CS 365 Foundations of Data Science
* CS 440 Intro to Artificial Intelligence
* CS 480 Intro to Computer Graphics
* CS 505 Intro to Natural Language Processing
* CS 506 Tools for Data Science
* CS 507 Intro to Optimization in ML
* CS 523 Deep Learning
* CS 530 Advanced Algorithms
* CS 531 Advanced Optimization Algorithms
* CS 533 Spectral Methods
* CS 542 Machine Learning
* CS 565 Algorithmic Data Mining
* CS 581 Computational Fabrication
* CS 583 Audio Computation

In each of these you will use and build on your knowledge of linear algebra.
