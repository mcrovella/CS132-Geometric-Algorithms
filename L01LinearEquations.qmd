Al-Khowarizmi gave his name to the _algorithm_.  

He wrote a book called _ilm al-jabr wa'l-muqābala'_ which means "The science of restoring what is missing and equating like with like."

Our entry point into linear algebra will be __solving systems of linear equations.__

Here is a famous example of such a problem.

> The yield of one bundle of inferior rice, two bundles of medium grade rice, and three bundles of superior rice is 39 _dou_ of grain.  The yield of one bundle of inferior rice, three bundles of medium grade rice, and two bundles of superior rice is 34 _dou_.  The yield of three bundles of inferior rice, two bundles of medium grain rice, and one bundle of superior rice is 26 _dou_.  What is the yield of one bundle of each grade of rice?
