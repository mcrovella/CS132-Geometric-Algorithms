So far we've been treating the matrix equation

$$ A{\bf x} = {\bf b}$$

as simply another way of writing the vector equation

$$ x_1{\bf a_1} + \dots + x_n{\bf a_n} = {\bf b}.$$

::: {.fragment}
However, we'll now think of the matrix equation in a new way: 

We will think of $A$ as <font color=blue>"acting on" the vector ${\bf x}$</font> to create a <font color=blue>new vector ${\bf b}$.</font>
:::

::: {.fragment}
For example, let's let $A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}2&1&1\\3&1&-1\end{array}\right].$  Then we find:

$$ A \left[\begin{array}{r}1\\-4\\-3\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{r}-5\\2\end{array}\right] $$
:::

::: {.fragment}
In other words, if ${\bf x} = \left[\begin{array}{r}1\\-4\\-3\end{array}\right]$ and ${\bf b} = \left[\begin{array}{r}-5\\2\end{array}\right]$, then $A$ _transforms_ ${\bf x}$ into ${\bf b}$.

::: {.fragment}
Notice what $A$ has done: it took a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and transformed it into a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
:::

::: {.fragment}
How does this fact relate to the shape of $A$?   

$A$ is $2 \times 3$ --- that is, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{2\times 3}$.
:::

::: {.fragment}
This gives a __new__ way of thinking about solving $A{\bf x} = {\bf b}$.  

To solve $A{\bf x} = {\bf b}$, we much "search for" the vector(s) ${\bf x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are transformed into ${\bf b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the "action" of $A$. 
:::

::: {.fragment}
For a different $A$, the mapping might be from $\mathbb{R}^1$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$:

:::

::: {.fragment}
What would the shape of $A$ be in the above case?
:::

::: {.fragment}
Since $A$ maps from $\mathbb{R}^1$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 1}$.  

That is, $A$ has 3 rows and 1 column.
:::

::: {.fragment}
In another case, $A$ could be a square $2\times 2$ matrix.  

Then, it would map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$:

:::

::: {.fragment}
We have moved out of the familiar world of functions of one variable:  we are now thinking about <font color = blue>functions that transform a vector into a vector.</font>

Or, put another way, functions that transform multiple variables into multiple variables.
