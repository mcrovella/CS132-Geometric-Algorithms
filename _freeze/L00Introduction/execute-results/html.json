On the one hand it is clean and beautiful.  If you have three vectors in 12-dimensional space, you can almost see them. [...]\n> [And] It is _needed_ and _used_. [...] Linear algebra has become as basic and as applicable as calculus, and fortunately it is easier.\n\nGilbert Strang\n\n> This course is potentially the most interesting and worthwhile undergraduate mathematics course you will complete.\n\nDavid Lay\n\n##\n\n__The dominance of linear algebra arises because it is so fundamental,__ and in some ways, very simple.  \n\nIt deals with objects that almost always can be interpreted geometrically.  So often we can use linear algebra in a very intuitive manner -- so much so that many times it is actually the best way to think about geometric problems. \n\nBut it is also rigorous and captures situations that sometimes we would overlook if we were proceeding purely intuitively.  This is because it is also about solving equations, and finding solutions to various kinds of problems.  So the advantage of being basic and fundamental is that it can be used and applied in so many ways.\n\n",
